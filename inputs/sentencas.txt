Today I had a severe headache that prevented me from working.
Unfortunately, I had to go to the doctor, where I received some bad news.
I will have to rest for a week.

Today I spent the whole afternoon at the park with my friends, it was a lot of fun remembering some stories.
It's a shame we had to go back early because of the sudden rain.
